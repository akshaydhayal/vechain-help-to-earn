4. **Upvoting**: Community upvotes quality questions and answers (0.05 B3TR per question upvote, 0.1 B3TR per answer upvote)
5. **Answer Approval**: Question asker approves the best answer (cannot be their own)
6. **Reward Distribution**: Approved answerer receives VET bounty and 1 B3TR token
7. **B3TR Notifications**: Sequential notifications show who earned what rewards

### Security Flow
1. **Validation**: All actions validated at contract and frontend level
2. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for all failure cases

## 💰 B3TR Token Rewards System

### Reward Distribution Model
The platform implements a sophisticated B3TR token rewards system with the following structure:

#### **Question-Level Rewards (Max 5 B3TR per question)**
- **Question Asker (10%)**: 0.05 B3TR per upvote (max 10 upvotes = 0.5 B3TR)
- **First Answer (10%)**: 0.5 B3TR automatic reward for first answer
- **Approved Answer (20%)**: 1 B3TR automatic reward for approved answer
- **Upvoted Answers (60%)**: 0.1 B3TR per upvote (max 30 upvotes = 3 B3TR)

#### **Dynamic Capping System**
- **Geometric Decay**: Rewards decrease proportionally but never reach zero
- **Question Cap**: `min(Available_Funds / 10, 5 B3TR)` per question
- **Minimum Threshold**: 0.1 B3TR minimum reward for new questions
- **Sustainability**: Ensures rewards are available for all questions

#### **VeBetterDAO Integration**
- **Real B3TR Tokens**: Direct integration with VeBetterDAO X2EarnRewardsPool
- **App ID**: `0x84fa8dbad98867a7b701a7e4af83cdb6da20b04a335044b82e0445128b67228e`

- **Contract**: `0x5F8f86B8D0Fa93cdaE20936d150175dF0205fB38`

#### **User Experience**
- **Sequential Notifications**: Transaction hash → B3TR reward notifications
- **Visual Recognition**: First answer tags with star icons
- **Real-time Updates**: Optimistic UI with blockchain confirmation
- **Balance Display**: Simulated B3TR balances for testnet compatibility

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Anti-Farming Mechanisms

1. **Self-Approval Prevention**
   - Question askers cannot approve their own answers
   - Contract-level validation with clear error messages
   - Frontend UI prevents invalid actions

2. **Post-Approval Lock**
   - Once an answer is approved, no more approvals possible
   - Maintains "one approved answer per question" rule
   - UI automatically hides approve buttons after approval

3. **One-Time Upvoting**
   - Users can only upvote each question/answer once
   - Prevents reputation farming through multiple upvotes
   - Clear feedback when attempting to upvote again

4. **User Identity Validation**
   - Decoupled user identity from transaction sender
   - Prevents impersonation attacks
   - Centralized fee payer with distinct user actions

5. **VeBetterDAO Integration Safety**
   - Graceful degradation if rewards system fails
   - Core functionality works even if VeBetterDAO is down
   - Optional reward distribution doesn't break approvals
