# Question Display Implementation - Real Contract Data

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED:**

The dApp now fetches and displays real questions from the smart contract with a beautiful UI, enabling users to view, answer, upvote, and approve answers.

## 🔧 **KEY IMPLEMENTATIONS:**

### 1. **Contract Data Service** (`contractDataService.ts`)
```typescript
// Service for fetching real data from smart contract
export class ContractDataService {
  // Fetch platform statistics
  async getPlatformStats(): Promise<PlatformStats>
  
  // Fetch all questions from contract
  async getAllQuestions(): Promise<Question[]>
  
  // Fetch answers for specific question
  async getQuestionAnswers(questionId: number): Promise<Answer[]>
  
  // Get user profile information
  async getUserProfile(userAddress: string): Promise<UserProfile>
}
```

### 2. **Question Card Component** (`QuestionCard.tsx`)
```typescript
// Beautiful UI component for displaying individual questions
export function QuestionCard({
  question,
  answers,
  onAnswerSubmit,
  onUpvote,
  onApprove,
  isTransactionPending,
  currentUser
}) {
  // Displays question with:
  // - Title and description
  // - Bounty amount and status
  // - Asker information and timestamp
  // - All answers with upvote/approve functionality
  // - Answer submission form
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Question Interface**
```typescript
interface Question {
  id: number;
  asker: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  bounty: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  hasApprovedAnswer: boolean;
  approvedAnswerId: string;
  timestamp: number;
}

interface Answer {
  id: number;
  questionId: number;
  answerer: string;
  content: string;
  upvotes: number;
  isApproved: boolean;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### 4. **Real Contract Data Integration**
```typescript
const loadPlatformData = async () => {
  // Load platform stats from contract
  const platformStats = await contractDataService.getPlatformStats();
  
  // Load questions from contract
  const contractQuestions = await contractDataService.getAllQuestions();
  
  // Load answers for each question
  const answersData = {};
  for (const question of contractQuestions) {
    const questionAnswers = await contractDataService.getQuestionAnswers(question.id);
    answersData[question.id] = questionAnswers;
  }
};
```
